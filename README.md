# PPGR-prediction

PPGR-prediction is a collection of codebook that we use to analyze data and develope the models for PPGR prediction study entitled "Enhancing Glycemic Management in Type 2 Diabetes with a Comprehensive Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Post-Prandial Glycemic Response Prediction." 

## Workflow
Our study workflow is consisted of 4 phases as follow.  
(1) Data collection & analysis  
(2) Model development   
(3) Model evaluation  
(4) Model interpretation  

Our codebook open the code for data analysis (risk factor analysis and subgroup analysis) and DNN model development, evaluation and interpretation.
